## About Me

I am an experienced developer who has been focusing on **PHP** since the age of 13, with a passion for web development, system architecture, and API integration.

With a strong commitment to technical excellence and continuous improvement, I seek to apply my skills to challenging projects that demand high performance and security.

- Specializing in **Web Development** and **API** integration.
- Experience in building robust systems with a focus on **scalability** and **high performance**.
- Proficient in **information security** best practices.
- Significant contributions to diverse projects, including enterprise platforms, educational systems, and **banking** solutions.
- Skilled in creating dynamic web applications and managing complex databases.

## Experience Highlights

My career has been shaped by solving complex problems, transforming legacy systems into modern solutions, and creating innovative products from scratch. Here are the pillars of my work:

* **High-Performance Architecture:** I specialize in designing and implementing systems that support massive traffic volumes. My approach includes microservices architecture, multiple caching layers (Redis, Memcached), message queues (AWS SQS), and database optimization to ensure scalability and minimal response times. A key proof of this is rewriting a system to achieve **60x superior performance** compared to its legacy version.

* **Automation and Efficiency:** I have extensive experience in automating complex processes to increase efficiency and reduce delivery times. I have developed over **230 data extractors** using Selenium and anti-captcha systems, created automated deployment pipelines (CI/CD with GitLab), and built QA automation tools (QA Snapshot), optimizing the entire development lifecycle.

* **Security-First Mindset:** Security is a cornerstone of all my projects. I have worked on mapping and fixing vulnerabilities for large corporations (Grupo Cosan), implemented Web Application Firewall (WAF) solutions, and delivered systems for the banking sector (Banco BMG) that passed rigorous security tests with **zero vulnerabilities found**.

* **Innovation and Creative Solutions:** I enjoy going beyond the conventional by applying cutting-edge technologies to create unique solutions. I have developed **Artificial Intelligence** systems with image recognition (Google Vision), **Virtual Reality** platforms with C# and WebAssembly, and even an After Effects video rendering pipeline controlled by PHP and OCR.

## Flames
I created **Flames**, the world's first "cross-side" PHP framework, to redefine what's possible with the language. My vision was to build a single tool that empowers developers to create high-performance web, desktop, and console applications with a unified PHP codebase.

Flames is the result of years of experience building mission-critical systems, now rebuilt as an open-source project to push the boundaries of PHP development.

## Why Flames is a Game-Changer

**Run PHP on the Frontend**
Say goodbye to JavaScript fatigue. Flames executes **PHP natively in the browser** using WebAssembly, allowing you to build rich, reactive user interfaces with the language you already love.

**Extreme Performance**
Engineered for high-traffic applications, Flames is up to **18x faster than Laravel**. It delivers the speed of a micro-framework without sacrificing the powerful features you need.

**More Than a Web Framework**
Flames transcends the web. You can build **native desktop apps** for Windows & Linux (via Electron), generate fast **static sites**, and create powerful **console applications**â€”all from one cohesive framework.
